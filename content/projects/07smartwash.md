I started this project by disseminating online survey to get user pain points from their experience using washing machine.  From the information I gatherered, I brainstormed on the solutions to the challengess, which form the basis for the feaure I displayed in the washing machine app.

    After this, I brainstormed on all possible solutions to address the painpoints, I noted different kinds of suggestions. The idea was to get large quantity of ideas that can be narrowd down late. I came up with the features for the mobile app before moving on the design the low fidelity prototype.

I used neumorphism desing throughout the entire app inface because it makes it look real. Just as if user is using a washing machine with physical control. Check out some of the screens below.
