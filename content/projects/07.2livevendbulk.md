      The Problem
    </div>
    <div class="pt-2 lg:pt-6 leading-9">
    Transparency is a scarce and invaluable commodity in the world of procurment of many construction companies. The problem of deliverying materials that are not according to specification are on the rise. And the risk of awarding contracts to unqualified vendors comes with looses that is being suffered by construction comapanies.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
  <span class = "text-black dark:text-white font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl "> The Goal</span>
  <div class = "pt-2 lg:pt-6 leading-9"> Lack of transparency and losses that comes with the risk of awarding contractc to unverified vendors is what we are trying to reduce. So the goal is to build a platform that serves as an intermeidary between construction comapanies (buyers) and vendors (suppliers) thereby making procurement process easier, faster and transparent.</div>

                    I conducted interviews with 8 people in the  construction field who deal directly in procuring materials, There were a lot of insigth from this research from which I drew the empathy map.

After this he proceeds to payment which will be escrowed until he confirms the delivery of the materials. Furthermore he can use the chat featrue to negotiate more with the vendor.
