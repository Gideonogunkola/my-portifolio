  After this I decided on the font that will be most appropriate for the brand, here I chose a serif font as it best suit fashions and beautification industry. I designed a monogram logo to ensure it's versatility and easy identifacation for clients. The Monogram/lettermark logo is from the brand name - Kandra Signature. I started the color with black and white to see how good tha logo is. A logo that comes out well in black and white will sure do better when the right color is applied.

 After this stage, I started applying the righ color. I chose the colors that best represents the brand's value. Kandra Signature wants something tha is classy, and prestige. Emerald green and gold best represent these values. The combination of both colors speaks class and luxury.
