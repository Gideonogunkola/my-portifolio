The very first stage of my process was the empathy stage where I carried out research by conducting interviews for 8 people to understand their donating experiences. Below are some of the pain-points:
  <ol type="I" class ="pl-4 py-4">
    <li> Can't track donation records</li>
    <li> Don't have motivation to donate</li>
    <li>Hate lack of feedback from NGOs</li>
  </ol>
After curating the pain points, I created the empathy map which later guided me in creating personas for the project.

    After this, I brainstormed on all possible solutions to address the painpoints, I noted different kinds of suggestions. The idea was to get large quantity of ideas that can be narrowd down late. I came up with the features for the mobile app before moving on the design the low fidelity prototype.

With the low-fideity prototype created, i moved a step forward by desgning and getting all the visual elements needed for the app, and then later designed the high fidelity prototypes. After this stage, I invited some users that I interviewd earlir fo usability testing. Most of the users could use the app but only one of them couldn't not understand where to go from the main page, so I added a brief istruction direction for every new users. I also included some features such a voice bot, abd ability to change language that considers inclusion and accesibility.
